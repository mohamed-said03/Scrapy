# 🚀 Social Media Analysis

> *In today's digital world, social platforms generate vast amounts of unstructured data—text, images, videos, and interactions—creating opportunities for insights and trend forecasting. With over 5.31 billion users producing 1.45 trillion GB of data daily, organizations face two major challenges: efficiently collecting data with specific parameters and analyzing it cost-effectively. Our solution addresses both by offering an all-in-one, modular system that automates data scraping, storage, analysis, and visualization across platforms like Twitter and TikTok. It features a user-friendly dashboard, secure data handling, customizable data pipelines, AI-powered analysis tools (e.g., segment and video analysis), and structured data export options (e.g., JSON), all at a lower cost than competitors.*

### 🎓 Academic Context
- **Institution**: Zagazig University
- **Program**: Computer Science (CS)
- **Duration**: September 2024 - July 2025
- **Supervisor**: [Dr. Mahmmoud A.Mahdi](https://github.com/qursaan)
- **Grade Achieved**: High Excellent (A+)

### 🎯 Business Value
> #### Problem 
Existing social media data collection and analysis tools—whether open-source (e.g., Tweepy, and Twint) or commercial (e.g., Brandwatch and Apify)—suffer from key limitations:

- They often focus on specific platforms or tasks (e.g., only Twitter, or only sentiment detection).
- Require significant technical expertise or manual setup.
- Lack modularity and flexibility in building end-to-end workflows.
- Provide limited support for non-English languages, particularly Arabic.
- Rarely integrate advanced features such as tone, implied sentiment, or video analysis.
> #### Soltion 
The proposed system is a fully modular, workflow-based platform that automates the entire pipeline—from scraping data across multiple platforms (e.g., Twitter and TikTok) to analyzing and visualizing it using AI models, including Arabic NLP support. It offers:
- A user-friendly dashboard for both technical and non-technical users.
- Customizable data pipelines with plug-and-play components.
- Advanced analytics like tone detection and text classification.
- Export options in structured formats (e.g., JSON).
- All-in-one functionality at a lower cost than commercial competitors.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automated Multi-Platform Data Scraping**: Collects data from platforms like Twitter and TikTok, including trending hashtags and posts with specific tags. Users can manage and monitor multiple scraping tasks with full control, enabling efficient, real-time data collection for various use cases.
- **AI-Powered Social Media Analysis**: Offers advanced analytics like segment analysis, tone and implied sentiment detection, and video analysis. Supports multilingual content, including Arabic NLP, making it especially useful for diverse research and market needs.
- **Custom Data Pipelines & Workflow Management**: Users can build modular, end-to-end workflows—from scraping to analysis and visualization—tailored to specific project goals. Structured export options (e.g., JSON) enhance flexibility for external use.
- **Scalable & Fault-Tolerant Architecture**: Microservices-based backend with independent services for scraping, analysis, and storage. If one service or database fails, others continue running independently—ensuring high availability and seamless performance.
- **Subscription-Based Access**: Integrated with Stripe to offer monthly subscription plans. Users can upgrade to premium tiers to unlock higher usage limits including more concurrent processes, increased data scraping quotas, and advanced analytics access. The system automatically handles billing, plan changes, and secure payment processing.

### Technical Highlights
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive dashboard accessible across desktop, tablet, and mobile for seamless user experience.
- **Real-time Updates**: Live tracking of process status, scraping activities, and analysis results through dedicated APIs and background task monitoring.
- **Security**: Robust JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens ensures secure session handling; APIs are protected to restrict access to user-specific data.
- **Performance**: Optimized with sequential task processing, modular microservices, and isolated databases for different components to reduce bottlenecks and improve scalability.
- **Stripe Integration**: Manages user subscriptions and secure payments via Stripe, with support for plan upgrades, and automated billing.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Social media platforms generate 1.45 trillion GB of unstructured data daily from over 5.31 billion users, including text, images, videos, and interactions. Businesses, researchers, and analysts need to extract actionable insights from this massive data stream—but face two major challenges:
- Who faces this problem:
  - Businesses aiming to understand customer behavior and market trends.
  - Researchers and analysts conducting large-scale studies or sentiment analysis.
  - Developers and data scientists building NLP or social media tools.
- Why existing solutions are inadequate:
  - Open-source tools (e.g., Tweepy, and Twint) are limited to specific platforms, require manual configuration, and demand high technical expertise.
  - Commercial tools (e.g., Brandwatc) offer limited customization and are expensive.
  - Most systems lack multilingual support, especially for Arabic.
  - There's a lack of modular, all-in-one platforms that combine scraping, analysis, and visualization under one roof. 
- What the impact of the problem:
  - Valuable insights remain locked in unstructured data.
  - Manual, time-consuming workflows reduce productivity and slow decision-making.
  - Arabic-speaking regions and multilingual markets are underrepresented in analytics tools.

### Our Solution
We provide a modular, automated, and scalable system that streamlines the entire social media data pipeline—from scraping and storage to AI-driven analysis and visualization—supporting platforms like Twitter and TikTok.
- Key innovation or unique approach
  - All-in-one platform with microservices architecture, Arabic NLP support, and a user-friendly dashboard.
  - Enables users to define custom workflows, analyze data in real-time, and download structured results (e.g., JSON)
- How your solution differs from alternatives
  - More flexible and cost-effective than commercial tools
  - Easier to use and more powerful than fragmented open-source tools
  - Offers video analysis, tone/implied sentiment detection, and real-time process management—features often missing in other platforms
### Target Audience
- Businesses (marketing teams, product managers)
- Researchers and academics (with or without technical backgrounds)
- Data analysts and scientists needing scalable, customizable pipelines
